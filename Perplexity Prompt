My Gym has Members and runs sessions.
A member has a name and a status which may be "Booked", "Waitlisted" or "Checked in".
A session has a date, a time and an array of members.
Implement (not in Python) local storage for an array of sessions.
Initialize this storage from a JSON string.
Implement a web page to list these sessions with each session headed with its date and time 
followed by a table with a  row for each member. 
The first column to be a button labeled in black on green with the members name and second column to be the status.
The button should change the status from "Booked" to "Checked in" and no more.
The "Booked" status should be black on yellow. 
The "Waitlisted" status should be black on red. 
The "Checked in"" status should be black on green.
